# HW10B-Behavior-Trees

The py_trees_track_uturn directory contains two example behavior trees implemented using py_trees. This serves as the main repository for the behavior-tree implementation.

The steering_inference_image_bt.py files should be added to your previous autonomous-bot repository. This new module determines the robot’s behavior based on the logic defined in the behavior-tree node. For additional details, please refer to the homework PDF and the workflow video.
